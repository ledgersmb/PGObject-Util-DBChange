=head1 NAME

PGObject::Util::DBChange - Track applied change files in the database

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.050.1

=cut

our $VERSION = '0.050.1';


=head1 SYNOPSIS

Quick summary of what the module does.

Perhaps a little code snippet.

    use PGObject::Util::DBChange;

    my $foo = PGObject::Util::DBChange->new();
    ...

=head1 PROPERTIES

=head2 path

Path to load content from -- Must be defined and '' or a string

=cut

has path => (is => 'ro',
             isa => sub { die 'path undefined' unless defined $_[0]; 
                          die 'references not allowed' if ref $_[0]; } );

=head2 no_transactions

If true, we assume success even if transaction fails

Future versions may add additional checking possibilies instead

=cut

has no_transactions =>(is => 'ro');

=head2 content

Content of the file.  Can be specified at load, or is built by reading from the
file.

=cut

has content => (is => 'lazy');

sub _build_content {
    my ($self) = @_;
    my $file;
    local $!;
    open(FILE, '<', $self->path) or
        die 'FileError: ' . Cwd::abs_path($self->path) . ": $!";
    binmode FILE, ':utf8';
    my $content = join '', <FILE>;
    close FILE;
    return $content;
}

=head2 succeeded (rwp)

Undefined until run.  After run, 1 if success, 0 if failure.

=cut

has succeeded => (is => 'rwp');

=head2 dependencies

A list of other changes to apply first.  If strings are provided, these are
turned into path objects.

Currently these must be explicitly provided. Future bersions may read these from
comments in the files themselves.

=cut

has dependencies => (is => 'ro',
                     default => sub { [] },
                     isa => sub {  die 'dependencies must be an arrayref' 
                                           if ref $_[0] !~ /ARRAY/
                                              and defined $_[0];
                                   for (@{$_[0]}) {
                                       die 'dependency must be a PGObject::Util::Change object'
                                           unless eval { $_->isa(__PACKAGE__) };
                                   }
                           }
                    );
                                           

=head2 sha

The sha hash of the normalized content (comments and whitespace lines stripped)
of the file.

=cut

has sha => (is => 'lazy');

sub _build_sha {
    my ($self) = @_;
    my $content = $self->content; 
    my $normalized = join "\n",
                     grep { /\S/ }
                     map { my $string = $_; $string =~ s/--.*//; $string }
                     split("\n", $content);
    return Digest::SHA::sha512_base64($normalized);
}

=head2 begin_txn

Code to begin transaction, defaults to 'BEGIN;'

=cut

has begin_txn => (is => 'ro', default => 'BEGIN;');

=head2 commit_txn

Code to commit transaction, defaults to 'COMMIT;'

Useful if one needs to do two phase commit or similar

=cut

has commit_txn => (is => 'ro', default => 'COMMIT;');

=head1 METHODS

=head1 Functions (package-level)

=head2 needs_init($dbh)

Checks to see whether the schema has been initialized

=head2 init($dbh);

Initializes the system.  Modifications are maintained through the History
module.  Returns 0 if was up to date, 1 if was initialized.
